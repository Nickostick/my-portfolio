# Hello, World!

Welcome to my digital corner of the internet, styled after the operating system that defined a generation.

## Why This Site?

I wanted to create something memorable. Something that stands out from the sea of minimalist portfolios and generic templates.

Windows 98 wasn't just an operating system - it was an experience. The satisfying click of buttons, the iconic teal desktop, the promise of endless possibilities in a digital frontier.

## What You'll Find Here

**Thoughts** - Essays, ideas, and observations about technology, life, and everything in between.

**Workouts** - Because a healthy body supports a healthy mind.

**Resume** - The professional stuff, if that's what you're here for.

Feel free to drag the windows around. Click the icons. Explore. That's what this desktop was made for.
