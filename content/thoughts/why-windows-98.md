# Why I Built a Windows 98 Portfolio

Every developer portfolio looks the same. Dark mode. Minimalist. Maybe some subtle animations if they're feeling fancy.

I wanted something different.

## The Nostalgia Factor

Windows 98 holds a special place in computing history. It was the gateway to the internet for millions. The first encounter with digital creativity for a generation of kids who would grow up to build the modern web.

There's power in nostalgia. It creates an emotional connection that no amount of sleek design can replicate.

## Technical Challenges

Building this wasn't just an aesthetic choice - it was a technical exercise:

**No frameworks.** Just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sometimes the simplest tools are the best.

**Window management.** Making draggable, resizable windows that feel authentic required understanding CSS positioning deeply.

**Responsive design meets retro UI.** How do you make a desktop metaphor work on mobile? You adapt. Full-screen "apps" on small screens, windowed experience on desktop.

## Standing Out

In a world of sameness, be different. This portfolio is a conversation starter. It shows personality. It demonstrates that I can take a creative concept and execute it technically.

And honestly? It was fun to build.
